  abstract      = {An old theorem of Ad\'amek constructs initial algebras for sufficiently cocontinuous endofunctors via transfinite iteration over ordinals in classical set theory. We prove a new version that works in constructive logic, using "inflationary" iteration over a notion of size that abstracts from limit ordinals just their transitive, directed and well-founded properties. Borrowing from Taylor's constructive treatment of ordinals, we show that sizes exist with upper bounds for any given signature of indexes. From this it follows that there is a rich class of endofunctors to which the new theorem applies, provided one admits a weak form of choice (WISC) due to Streicher, Moerdijk, van den Berg and Palmgren, and which is known to hold in the internal constructive logic of many kinds of topos.},

  abstract      = {The initial algebra for an endofunctor F provides a recursion and induction scheme for data structures whose constructors are described by F. The initial-algebra construction by Ad\'amek (1974) starts with the initial object (e.g. the empty set) and successively applies the functor until a fixed point is reached, an idea inspired by Kleene's fixed point theorem. Depending on the functor of interest, this may require transfinitely many steps indexed by ordinal numbers until termination. We provide a new initial algebra construction which is not based on an ordinal-indexed chain. Instead, our construction is loosely inspired by Pataraia's fixed point theorem and forms the colimit of all finite recursive coalgebras. This is reminiscent of the construction of the rational fixed point of an endofunctor that forms the colimit of all finite coalgebras. For our main correctness theorem, we assume the given endofunctor is accessible on a (weak form of) locally presentable category. Our proofs are constructive and fully formalized in Agda.},
